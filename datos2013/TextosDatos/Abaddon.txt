The Hebrew term Abaddon (, ), an intensive form of the word "destruction," appears as a place of destruction in the Hebrew Bible.

In a vision in the New Testament Book of Revelation, a male angel called Abbadon is shown as the king of an army of locusts; his name is first transcribed in Greek as "whose name in Hebrew Abaddon" (Ἀβαδδὼν), and then translated as, "which in Greek means the Destroyer" (Apollyon, Ἀπολλύων). The Latin Vulgate, as well as the Douay Rheims Bible, has an additional note (not present in the Greek text), "in Latin Exterminans", exterminans being the Latin word for "destroyer."

===Etymology===
According to the Brown Driver Briggs lexicon, the Hebrew abaddon (Hebrew: אבדון; avadon) is an intensive form of the Semitic root and verb stem abad (אָבַד) "perish" (transitive "destroy"), which occurs 184 times in the Hebrew Bible.

===Hebrew Bible===
The term abaddon appears six times in the Masoretic text of the Hebrew Bible; abaddon means destruction or "place of destruction," or the realm of the dead, and is associated with Sheol. 
* Job 26:6 - the grave (Sheol) is naked before Him, and destruction (Abaddon) has no covering.
* Job 28:22 - destruction (Abaddon) and death say...
* Job 31:12 - ..it is a fire that consumes to destruction (Abaddon)..
* Psalm 88:11 - Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave (Sheol) or thy faithfulness in destruction (Abaddon)?
* Proverbs 15:11 Hell (Sheol) and Destruction (Abaddon) are before the LORD, how much more than the hearts of the children of men?
* Proverbs 27:20 Hell (Sheol) and Destruction (Abaddon) are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied. KJV, 1611

===Second Temple era texts===
The text of the Thanksgiving Hymns — which was found in the Dead Sea Scrolls — tells of "the Sheol of Abaddon" and of the "torrents of Belial burst into Abaddon". The Biblical Antiquities (mis-attributed to Philo) mentions Abaddon as a place (sheol, hell), not as a spirit or demon or angel. Abaddon is also one of the compartments of Gehenna. Metzger & Coogan (1993) Oxford Companion to the Bible, p3. By extension, it can mean an underworld abode of lost souls, or hell.

===Rabbinical literature===
In some legends, Abaddon is identified as a realm where the "damned" lie in fire and snow, one of the places in "Hell" that Moses visited. The Legends of the Jews, volume II: From Joseph to Exodus, Lewis Ginzberg, 1909. 

==Christianity==
===Etymology===
The Greek term "the Destroyer" (Apollyon, Ἀπολλύων) is the active participle of apollumi (ἀπόλλυμι) "to destroy". The term is not used as a name in classical Greek texts. 

===New Testament===
The Christian scriptures contain the first known depiction of Abaddon as an individual entity instead of a place.
 

In Revelation 9:7-11, Abaddon is described as "The Destroyer", the angel of the abyss, and as the king of a plague of locusts resembling horses with crowned human faces, women's hair, lions' teeth, wings, and the tail of a scorpion that torment people for five months. 

===Christian tradition===
In the 3rd century Acts of Thomas, Abaddon is the name of a demon, or the Devil himself. 

Abaddon is given particularly important roles in two sources, a homily entitled The Enthronment of Abbaton by Timothy of Alexandria, and the Apocalypse of Bartholomew. Atiya, Aziz S. The Coptic Encyclopedia. New York: Macmillan Publishing Co., 1991. ISBN 0-02-897025-X In the homily by Timothy, Abbaton was first named Muriel, and had been given the task by God of collecting the earth which would be used in the creation of Adam. Upon completion of this task, the angel was then named to be guardian. Everybody, including the angels, demons, and corporeal entities, felt fear of him. Abbaton engaged in prayer and ultimately obtained the promise that any men who venerated him during their lifetime stood the chance of being saved. Abbaton is also said to have a prominent role in the Last Judgement, as the one who will take the souls to the Valley of Josaphat. He is described in the Apocalypse of Bartholomew as being present in the Tomb of Jesus at the moment of his resurrection. Gospel of Bartholomew Featured as Abbaton 

===Protestant commentators===
The symbolism of Revelation 9:11 leaves the exact identification of Abaddon open for interpretation. Matthew Henry (1708) believed Abaddon to be the antichrist, Matthew Henry Commentary on Revelation 9. Retrieved 15 April 2007 while Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Commentary (1871) and Henry H. Halley (1922) identified the angel as Satan. Robert Jamieson, DD, St. Paul's, Glasgow, Scotland; Rev. AR Fausset, AM, St. Cuthbert's, York, England ; and the Rev.

The International Bible Students Association (precursor to Jehovah's Witnesses) identified Abaddon as Satan in the 1917 seventh and final volume of Millennial Dawn, to which Charles Taze Russell's name was attached (although his authorship of the work is doubted). Charles Taze Russell’s Studies in the Scriptures, vol. 7, p. 159, 1917 edition Jehovah's Witnesses now take the contrasting view, believing that Abaddon is another name of the resurrected and enthroned Jesus Christ.
