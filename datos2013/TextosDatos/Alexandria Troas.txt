Alexandria Troas ("Alexandria of the Troad", modern ) is an ancient Greek city situated on the Aegean Sea near the northern tip of Turkey's western coast, a little south of Tenedos (modern Bozcaada). It is located in the modern Turkish province of Ã‡anakkale. The site sprawls over an estimated 400 ha; among the few structures still extant today are a ruined bath and gymnasium complex John Freely (2003). The Aegean Coast of Turkey. Redhouse Press, Istanbul, pp.3-8. and a recently uncovered stadium. 

==History==
===Hellenistic===
According to Strabo, this site was first called Sigeia; around 306 BC Antigonus refounded the city as the much-expanded Antigonia Troas by settling the people of five other towns in Sigeia, Jona Lendering (2006). Alexandria in Troas (from Livius.org). Retrieved 2010-4-15. including the once influential city of Neandria. Robert Jewett (2005). The Troas Project: Investigating Maritime and Land Routes to Clarify the Role of Alexandria Troas in Commerce and Religion. Retrieved 2010-4-15. Its name was changed by Lysimachus to Alexandria Troas, in memory of Alexander III of Macedon (Pliny merely states that the name changed from Antigonia to Alexandria Pliny, Naturalis Historia 5:124. ). As the chief port of north-west Asia Minor, the place prospered greatly in Roman times, becoming a "free and autonomous city" as early as 188 BC, and the existing remains sufficiently attest its former importance. In its heyday, the city may have had a population of about 100,000. Strabo mentions that a Roman colony was created at the location in the reign of Augustus, named Colonia Alexandria Augusta Troas (called simply Troas during this period). Augustus, Hadrian and the rich grammarian Herodes Atticus contributed greatly to its embellishment; the aqueduct still preserved is due to the latter. Constantine considered making Troas the capital of the Roman Empire.

===Roman===
In Roman times, it was a significant port for travelling between Anatolia and Europe. Paul of Tarsus sailed for Europe for the first time from Alexandria Troas Paul of Tarsus. Acts 16:8-11. and returned there from Europe (it was there that the episode of the raising of Eutychus later occurred Acts 20:5-12. ). Ignatius of Antioch also paused at this city before continuing to his martyrdom at Rome. Ignatius of Antioch. Ad Philad. 11:2; Ad Smyrn. 12:1. 

===Byzantine===
Several of its later bishops are known: Marinus in 325; Niconius in 344; Sylvanus at the beginning of the 5th century; Pionius in 451; Leo in 787; Peter, friend of the Patriarch Ignatius, and adversary to Michael, in the ninth century. In the 10th century Troas is given as a suffragan of Cyzicus and distinct from the famous Troy (Heinrich Gelzer, Ungedruckte ... Texte der Notitiae episcopatuum, 552; Georgii Cyprii descriptio orbis romani, 64); it is not known when the city was destroyed and the diocese disappeared. The city remains a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church, Troadensis; the seat is vacant following the resignation of the last bishop in 1971. David M. Cheney (1996-2010). Troas (Titular See), Catholic-Hierarchy. Retrieved 2010-4-15. 

Troas is also a titular see of the Orthodox Church under the Ecumenical Patriarchate.

Bishop Savas of Troas Elected Metropolitan of Pittsburgh. Retrieved 2011-11-17. 

===Ottoman===
Karasid Turkomans settled in the area of the Troad in the 14th century. Their beylik was conquered by the Ottomans in 1336. The ruins of Alexandria Troas came to be known among the Turks as Eski Stambul, the "Old City". The site's stones were much plundered for building material (for example Mehmed IV took columns to adorn his Yeni Valide Mosque in Istanbul). As of the mid-18th century the site served as "a lurking place for bandetti". Richard Chandler. Travels in Asia Minor, 1764-65. Quoted in Freely, op. cit. 

===Modern===
By 1911 the site had been overgrown with vallonea oaks and much plundered, but the circuit of the old walls could still be traced, and in several places they were fairly well preserved. They had a circumference of about ten kilometres, and were fortified with towers at regular intervals. Remains of an ancient bath and gymnasium complex can be found within this area; this building is locally known as Bal Saray (Honey Palace) and was originally endowed by Herodes Atticus in the year 135. Trajan built an aqueduct which can still be traced. The harbour had two large basins, now almost choked with sand. It is the subject of a recent study by German archaeologists who are digging and surveying at the site. Their excavation has uncovered the remains of a large stadium dating to about 100 BC.
