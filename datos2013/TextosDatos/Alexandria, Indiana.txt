In the city are a Carnegie library and Beulah Park of 24 acres (97,000 m²) & home of the Madison County "4H Fair". The city is located in rich farm country, which produces corn, soybeans, and tomatoes; and is in the Indiana natural gas region, to which fact it owed its growth as a manufacturing center. It was one of the principal seats of the glass industry in Indiana – plate glass, lamp chimneys, mirrors, &c., were once manufactured here. Charles Corydon Hall, a New England engineer, arrived in Alexandria to help manage a steel mill just as its natural gas supply was exhausted around the turn of the 19th century. Hall stayed to invent the first successful mineral-fiber insulation and built a company to produce it. For some decades the banner of the local newspaper featured the verse "Alexandria, Indiana/Home of the Rock Wool/Not on the Nile/But just as worthwhile." The municipality owns and operates the water-works as well as the city schools. Alexandria was founded in 1836 and was chartered as a city in 1893.

Alexandria is also known as "Small Town USA" and holds an annual festival to honor this heritage.
Famous residents include Bill and Gloria Gaither, winners of five Grammys. Gaither Studios is a very busy recording center for different types of music. It is especially known for producing Gospel music.
