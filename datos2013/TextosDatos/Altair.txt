Altair (Alpha Aquilae, Alpha Aql, α Aquilae, α Aql, Atair) is the brightest star in the constellation Aquila and the twelfth brightest star in the night sky. It is an A-type main sequence star with an apparent visual magnitude of 0.77 and is one of the vertices of the Summer Triangle (the other two vertices are marked by Deneb and Vega).

Altair rotates rapidly, with a velocity at the equator of approximately 286 km/s. From values of v sin i and i in the second column of Table 1, Monnier et al. 2007. A study with the Palomar Testbed Interferometer revealed that Altair is not spherical, but is flattened at the poles due to its high rate of rotation.

Altair is located 16.7 light-years (5.13 parsecs) from Earth and is one of the closest stars visible to the naked eye. p. 194, The Brightest Stars: Discovering The Universe Through The Sky's Most Brilliant Stars, Fred Schaaf, Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2008, ISBN 978-0-471-70410-2. Along with Beta Aquilae and Gamma Aquilae, it forms the well-known line of stars sometimes referred to as the Family of Aquila or Shaft of Aquila. p. 190, Schaaf 2008. 

Altair is a type-A main sequence star with approximately 1.8 times the mass of the Sun and 11 times its luminosity. Altair possesses an extremely rapid rate of rotation; it has a rotational period of approximately 9 hours. For comparison, the equator of the Sun requires just over 25 days for a complete rotation. This rapid rotation forces Altair to be oblate; its equatorial diameter is over 20 percent greater than its polar diameter. 

Satellite measurements made in 1999 with the Wide Field Infrared Explorer showed that the brightness of Altair fluctuates slightly, varying by less than a thousandth of a magnitude. http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/0004-637X/619/2/1072/60499.text.html As a result, it was identified in 2005 as a δ Scuti variable star. Its light curve can be approximated by adding together a number of sine waves, with periods that range between 0.8 and 1.5 hours. Altair: The Brightest δ Scuti Star, D. L. Buzasi et al., The Astrophysical Journal 619, #2 (February 2005), pp. 1072–1076, , .

The angular diameter of Altair was measured interferometrically by R. Hanbury Brown and his co-workers at Narrabri Observatory in the 1960s. They found a diameter of 3 milliarcseconds. The stellar interferometer at Narrabri Observatory-II. The angular diameters of 15 stars, R. Hanbury Brown, J. Davis, L. R. Allen, and J. M. Rome, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society 137 (1967), pp. 393–417, . Although Hanbury Brown et al. realized that Altair would be rotationally flattened, they had insufficient data to experimentally observe its oblateness. Altair was later observed to be flattened by infrared interferometric measurements made by the Palomar Testbed Interferometer in 1999 and 2000. This work was published by G. T. van Belle and his co-authors in 2001. 

Theory predicts that, owing to Altair's rapid rotation, its surface gravity and effective temperature should be lower at the equator, making the equator less luminous than the poles. This phenomenon, known as gravity darkening or the von Zeipel effect, was confirmed for Altair by measurements made by the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer in 2001, and analyzed by Ohishi et al. (2004) and Peterson et al. (2006). Asymmetric Surface Brightness Distribution of Altair Observed with the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer, Naoko Ohishi, Tyler E. Nordgren, and Donald J. Hutter, The Astrophysical Journal 612, #1 (September 1, 2004), pp. 463–471, , . Also, A. Domiciano de Souza et al. (2005) verified gravity darkening using the measurements made by the Palomar and Navy interferometers, together with new measurements made by the VINCI instrument at the VLTI.

Altair is one of the few stars for which a direct image has been obtained. Gazing up at the Man in the Star?, Press Release 07-062, National Science Foundation, May 31, 2007. Accessed on line November 25, 2008. In 2006 and 2007, J. D. Monnier and his coworkers produced an image of Altair's surface from 2006 infrared observations made with the MIRC instrument on the CHARA array interferometer; this was the first time the surface of any main-sequence star, apart from the Sun, had been imaged. The false-color image was published in 2007 and can be seen above and to the left; the brighter regions are shown in white and darker regions in blue. In this image, North (the direction towards the North Celestial Pole) is up and East is left, and the white line is the rotational axis of Altair. The black grid shows lines of latitude and longitude in an Altair-centric coordinate system. The von Zeipel effect can be observed in the image, which shows a white spot near the pole and a darker equator. The equatorial radius of the star was estimated to be 2.03 solar radii, and the polar radius 1.63 solar radii—a 25% increase of the stellar radius from pole to equator. 

==Etymology, mythology, and culture==
The name Altair has been used since medieval times. It is an abbreviation of the Arabic phrase , an-nasr aṭ-ṭā’ir (). The term Al Nesr Al Tair appeared in Al Achsasi Al Mouakket catalogue, which was translated into Latin as Vultur Volans. This name was applied by the Arabs to the asterism of α, β, and γ Aquilae and probably goes back to the ancient Babylonians and Sumerians, who called α Aquilae the eagle star. pp. 17–18, A Dictionary of Modern Star Names, Paul Kunitzsch and Tim Smart, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Sky Publishing, 2006, ISBN 978-1-931559-44-7. The spelling Atair has also been used. p. 59–60, Star-names and Their Meanings, Richard Hinckley Allen, New York: G. E. Stechert, 1899. Medieval astrolabes of England and Western Europe depicted Altair and Vega as birds. 

The Koori people of Victoria also knew Altair as Bunjil, the Wedge-tailed Eagle, and β and γ Aquilae are his two wives the Black Swans. The people of the Murray River knew the star as Totyerguil. p. 4, Aboriginal mythology : an A-Z spanning the history of aboriginal mythology from the earliest legends to the present day, Mudrooroo, London: HarperCollins, 1994, ISBN 1-85538-306-3. The Murray River was formed when Totyerguil the hunter speared Otjout, a giant Murray Cod, who, when wounded, churned a channel across southern Australia before entering the sky as the constellation Delphinus. p. 115, Mudrooroo 1994. 

In Chinese, the asterism consisting of α, β, and γ Aquilae is known as (, ). Altair is thus known as (, , or more literally, Riverdrum 2). 香港太空館 - 研究資源 - 亮星中英對照表, Hong Kong Space Museum. Accessed on line November 26, 2008. However, it is better known by its other names: () or (), or in English, Cowherd Star. pp. 97–98, 161, The Chinese Reader's Manual, William Frederick Mayers, Shanghai: American Presbyterian Mission Press, 1874. p. 72, China, Japan, Korea Culture and Customs: Culture and Customs, Ju Brown and John Brown, 2006, ISBN 978-1-4196-4893-9. These names are from the love story of , Qī Xī, in which Niú Láng and his two children, β and γ Aquilae, are separated from their mother, (, ), the star Vega, by the Milky Way. They are only permitted to meet once a year, when the Milky Way is crossed by a bridge of magpies. pp. 105–107, Magic Lotus Lantern and Other Tales from the Han Chinese, Haiwang Yuan and Michael Ann Williams, Libraries Unlimited, 2006, ISBN 978-1-59158-294-6. The Japanese festival, in which Altair is known as , is based on this legend. pp. 238–240, The Romance of the Milky Way, Lafcadio Hearn, The Atlantic Monthly 96 (August 1905), pp. 238–250. 

The people of Micronesia called Altair as Mai-lapa, "big/old breadfruit", while the Māori people called this star as Poutu-te-rangi, "pillar of heaven". p. 175, The Lexicon of Proto Oceanic: The Culture and Environment of Ancestral Oceanic Society: The Physical Environment, Volume 2, Malcolm Ross, Andrew Pawley and Meredith Osmond, Canberra, The Australian National University E Press, 2007. 

Japan Airlines's Starjet 777-200 JA8983 was named Altair.

In astrology, the star Altair was ill-omened, portending danger from reptiles.
