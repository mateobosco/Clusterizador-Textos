Angela Vincent (born 1942) is a professor at Somerville College of Oxford University. She is the head of a research group, which is located in the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine and working on a wide range of biological disciplines encompassing molecular biology, biochemistry, cellular immunology and intracellular neurophysiology. The group's research is focused on autoimmune and genetic disorders of the neuromuscular junction and peripheral motor nerves. The principal autoimmune diseases studied are myasthenia gravis, the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome and acquired neuromyotonia. 

Her contributions are mainly on the roles of antibodies directed against ion channel at the nerve-muscle junction in the pathogenesis of above mentioned diseases. She has demonstrated that transfer of these antibodies across the placenta from the pregnant woman to the fetus in utero can cause developmental abnormalities. She has also worked on the principal gene mutations causing neuromuscular diseases.

In 2009 she presented the Leslie Oliver Oration at Queen's Hospital. The Second Leslie Oliver Oration
