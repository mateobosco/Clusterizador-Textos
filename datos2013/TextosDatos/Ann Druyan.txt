ISBN 0-684-84856-2. pp. 95-6: "Her interest in science came primarily from her interest in the philosophy of Karl Marx. . . . Druyan herself had, at the time, rather vaporous standards of evidence for her many sundry beliefs (as she later acknowledged). She believed . . . that Immanuel Velikovsky in the 1950s had correctly deduced the truth about the solar system. . . . She believed in the ancient astronauts of Erich von Daniken." Druyan freely acknowledged her past views but also asserted that they changed dramatically after marrying Carl Sagan.
