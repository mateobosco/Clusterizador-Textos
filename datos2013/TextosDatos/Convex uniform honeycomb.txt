The alternated cubic honeycomb is one of 28 space-filling uniform tessellations in Euclidean 3-space, composed of alternating yellow tetrahedra and red octahedra.
In geometry, a convex uniform honeycomb is a uniform tessellation which fills three-dimensional Euclidean space with non-overlapping convex uniform polyhedral cells.

Twenty-eight such honeycombs exist:
* the familiar cubic honeycomb and 7 truncations thereof;
* the alternated cubic honeycomb and 4 truncations thereof;
* 10 prismatic forms based on the uniform plane tilings (11 if including the cubic honeycomb);
* 5 modifications of some of the above by elongation and/or gyration.

They can be considered the three-dimensional analogue to the uniform tilings of the plane.

== History ==
* 1900: Thorold Gosset enumerated the list of semiregular convex polytopes with regular cells (Platonic solids) in his publication On the Regular and Semi-Regular Figures in Space of n Dimensions, including one regular cubic honeycomb, and two semiregular forms with tetrahedra and octahedra.
* 1905: Alfredo Andreini enumerated 25 of these tessellations.
* 1991: Norman Johnson's manuscript Uniform Polytopes identified the complete list of 28.
* 1994: Branko Grünbaum, in his paper Uniform tilings of 3-space, also independently enumerated all 28, after discovering errors in Andreini's publication. He found the 1905 paper, which listed 25, had 1 wrong, and 4 being missing. Grünbaum states in this paper that Norman Johnson deserves priority for achieving the same enumeration in 1991. He also mentions that I. Alexeyev of Russia had contacted him regarding a putative enumeration of these forms, but that Grünbaum was unable to verify this at the time.
* 2006: George Olshevsky, in his manuscript Uniform Panoploid Tetracombs, along with repeating the derived list of 11 convex uniform tilings, and 28 convex uniform honeycombs, expands a further derived list of 143 convex uniform tetracombs (Honeycombs of uniform polychora in 4-space).

Only 14 of the convex uniform polyhedra appear in these patterns:
* three of the five Platonic solids,
* six of the thirteen Archimedean solids, and
* five of the infinite family of prisms.

=== Names ===
This set can be called the regular and semiregular honeycombs. It has been called the Archimedean honeycombs by analogy with the convex uniform (non-regular) polyhedra, commonly called Archimedean solids. Recently Conway has suggested naming the set as the Architectonic tessellations and the dual honeycombs as the Catoptric tessellations.

The individual honeycombs are listed with names given to them by Norman Johnson. (Some of the terms used below are defined in Uniform polychoron#Geometric derivations.)

For cross-referencing, they are given with list indices from Andreini (1-22), Williams(1-2,9-19), Johnson (11-19, 21-25, 31-34, 41-49, 51-52, 61-65), and Grünbaum(1-28).

== Compact Euclidean uniform tessellations (by their infinite Coxeter group families) ==
Fundamental domains in a cubic element of three groups.
Family correspondences
The fundamental infinite Coxeter groups for 3-space are:
# The , , cubic, (8 unique forms plus one alternation)
# The , , alternated cubic, (11 forms, 3 new)
# The cyclic group, or )], (5 forms, one new)

There is a correspondence between all three families. Removing one mirror from produces , and removing one mirror from produces . This allows multiple constructions of the same honeycombs. If cells are colored based on unique positions within each Wythoff construction, these different symmetries can be shown.

In addition there are 5 special honeycombs which don't have pure reflectional symmetry and are constructed from reflectional forms with elongation and gyration operations.

The total unique honeycombs above are 18.

The prismatic stacks from infinite Coxeter groups for 3-space are:
# The x, x prismatic group, (2 new forms)
# The x, x prismatic group, (7 unique forms)
# The x, (3 3 3)x prismatic group, (No new forms)
# The xx, xx prismatic group, (These all become a cubic honeycomb)

In addition there is one special elongated form of the triangular prismatic honeycomb.

The total unique prismatic honeycombs above (excluding the cubic counted previously) are 10.

Combining these counts, 18 and 10 gives us the total 28 uniform honeycombs.

=== The C~3, group (cubic) ===
The regular cubic honeycomb, represented by Schläfli symbol {4,3,4}, offers seven unique derived uniform honeycombs via truncation operations. (One redundant form, the runcinated cubic honeycomb, is included for completeness though identical to the cubic honeycomb.)

=== B~4, group ===

The group offers 11 derived forms via truncation operations, four being unique uniform honeycombs.

The honeycombs from this group are called alternated cubic because the first form can be seen as a cubic honeycomb with alternate vertices removed, reducing cubic cells to tetrahedra and creating octahedron cells in the gaps.

Nodes are indexed left to right as 0,1,0',3 with 0' being below and interchangeable with 0. The alternate cubic names given are based on this ordering.

=== Nonwythoffian forms (gyrated and elongated) ===
Three more uniform honeycombs are generated by breaking one or another of the above honeycombs where its faces form a continuous plane, then rotating alternate layers by 60 or 90 degrees (gyration) and/or inserting a layer of prisms (elongation).

The elongated and gyroelongated alternated cubic tilings have the same vertex figure, but are not alike. In the elongated form, each prism meets a tetrahedron at one triangular end and an octahedron at the other. In the gyroelongated form, prisms that meet tetrahedra at both ends alternate with prisms that meet octahedra at both ends.

The gyroelongated triangular prismatic tiling has the same vertex figure as one of the plain prismatic tilings; the two may be derived from the gyrated and plain triangular prismatic tilings, respectively, by inserting layers of cubes.

=== Prismatic stacks ===
Eleven prismatic tilings are obtained by stacking the eleven uniform plane tilings, shown below, in parallel layers. (One of these honeycombs is the cubic, shown above.) The vertex figure of each is an irregular bipyramid whose faces are isosceles triangles.

==== The C~2×I~1(&infin;), ×, prismatic group ====

There's only 3 unique honeycombs from the square tiling, but all 6 tiling truncations are listed below for completeness, and tiling images are shown by colors corresponding to each form.

===Examples===
All 28 of these tessellations are found in crystal arrangements.

The alternated cubic honeycomb is of special importance since its vertices form a cubic close-packing of spheres. The space-filling truss of packed octahedra and tetrahedra was apparently first discovered by Alexander Graham Bell and independently re-discovered by Buckminster Fuller (who called it the octet truss and patented it in the 1940s).

. Octet trusses are now among the most common types of truss used in construction.

If cells are allowed to be uniform tilings, more uniform honeycombs can be defined:

Families:
*x: Cubic prismatic slab honeycomb (3 forms)
*x: Tri-hexagonal prismatic slab honeycomb (8 forms)
* x: Triangular prismatic slab (No new forms)
*xx: = Cubic column honeycomb (1 form)
*x: Prismatic column honeycomb
* xx: = - = (Same as cubic slab honeycomb family)

== Hyperbolic forms ==
The {5,3,4} honeycomb in 3D hyperbolic space, viewed in perspective

There are 9 Coxeter group families of compact uniform honeycombs in hyperbolic 3-space, generated as Wythoff constructions, and represented by ring permutations of the Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams for each family. 

From these 9 families, there are a total of 76 unique honeycombs generated:
* : - 9 forms
* : - 15 forms
* : - 9 forms
* : - 11 forms (7 overlap with family, 4 are unique)
* : - 9 forms
* : - 6 forms
* : - 9 forms
* : - 9 forms
* : - 6 forms

The full list of hyperbolic uniform honeycombs has not been proven and an unknown number of non-Wythoffian forms exist. One known example is in the {3,5,3} family.

There are also 23 noncompact Coxeter groups of rank 4. These families can produce uniform honeycombs with unbounded facets or vertex figure, including ideal vertices at infinity:
