The Bush is a term Alaskans use to describe portions of their state that are not connected to the North America road network. A majority of Alaska's native populations live in the Bush, where they make their living in similar fashion to their ancestors. 

Places in the Bush include Bethel, Dillingham, King Salmon, Nome, Barrow, Katmai National Park, Kodiak Island, Kotzebue, and Unalaska-Dutch Harbor. 

Most parts of Alaska that are off the road system can only be reached by small airplane. Travel from place to place is typically accomplished by snowmobile, snow machine, boat, or dog sled.
